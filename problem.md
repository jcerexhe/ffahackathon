# FFA Hackathon

### Problem Breakdown

Brief
To improve the ability, access and pathway for females to become involved in the game of football as a player, coach, referee or volunteer

Men's game dominates viewership
There aren't enough female player role models
There's not as much money
Less investment
therefore less players

Women's game is less exciting/skillful

Get people excited by the games/players

Discover women players
See how good they are
Few incentives for people to make videos highlighting female players

Easy to share on social media
